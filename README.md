# Bilingual-Machine-Translation-Spanish-to-English-and-English-to-Spanish-using-LSTM

This project focuses on developing a bilingual machine translation system for Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish translation using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on the Tatoeba dataset, a publicly available parallel corpus containing 141,543 sentence pairs in both languages. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate translation system capable of handling linguistic challenges such as differences in word order, gendered nouns, verb conjugations, and articles between Spanish and English. By leveraging LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, the project aims to address these challenges and produce fluent, contextually accurate translations. This work builds on recent advancements in Neural Machine Translation (NMT), particularly the use of LSTM networks to capture long-term dependencies and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem commonly faced by traditional RNNs.
